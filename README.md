# Gibhun: Real-Time Emotion Enhancer

**Gibhun** is a real-time facial emotion recognition system built using OpenCV and DeepFace. It analyzes a user's facial expression from live webcam input and intelligently maps it to extended emotional states like *Sleepy*, *Tired*, *Bored*, and *Excited*.

## 🔥 Features
- Real-time emotion detection using your webcam
- Extended emotion mapping beyond basic facial expressions
- Uses [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) for facial analysis
- Simple OpenCV interface

## 🧠 How It Works

The program captures video frames and uses DeepFace to detect the dominant emotion. A custom function then extends these emotions to interpret more nuanced feelings based on combinations and intensity levels.
